    "explanation": "This requires synthesis of colorectal surgery principles, IBD management, and patient lifestyle factors. J-pouch reconstruction is appropriate for ulcerative colitis but requires careful patient selection. Mild perianal disease is not an absolute contraindication, but staging allows for healing and assessment of disease activity. The 3-6 month timeline allows completion before marriage while ensuring adequate healing. Anti-TNF therapy may need adjustment perioperatively.",

    "question": "A 45-year-old woman with BRCA1 mutation has completed childbearing and requests prophylactic surgery. She has no evidence of breast or ovarian cancer. Her mother died of ovarian cancer at age 50, and her sister had breast cancer at age 35. Evaluate the optimal prophylactic surgical strategy.",

      "Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy only",

      "Enhanced screening without prophylactic surgery",
      "Unilateral mastectomy with contralateral surveillance"
    ],
    "correct_option": "Bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy",
    "explanation": "This requires synthesis of genetic counseling, oncologic principles, and patient counseling. BRCA1 mutations confer high lifetime risk for both breast and ovarian cancer. Given the patient's age, family history, and completed childbearing, bilateral prophylactic mastectomy with reconstruction and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy provides maximum risk reduction. The timing is appropriate as she has completed childbearing and is approaching the age of increased ovarian cancer risk.",
